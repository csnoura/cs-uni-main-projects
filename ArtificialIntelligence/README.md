# Tenner Grid Puzzle Solver
This project solves the Tenner Grid puzzle, where a 3x10 grid must be filled with numbers 0-9 in each row, ensuring no repeats in rows, column sums match the target, and adjacent cells (including diagonals) have different values. The solver uses **backtracking** and **forward checking** with the **Minimum Remaining Value (MRV)** heuristic to efficiently find valid solutions.

## Highlights
- Random Puzzle Generation.
- Backtracking Algorithm: Explores possible solutions while adhering to puzzle constraints.
- Forward Checking with MRV: Reduces the search space by prioritizing cells with the fewest valid options.
